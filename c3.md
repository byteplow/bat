## C3 I0
- what do i want to archive
    - what should be better
        - current state
        - ap should be more resiliant
        - no dependencies on instacnes owingin entities
            - long therem
        - short term resilience
    - what should not become wors
        - i would linke to keep generic servers - with specifc clients
            - also if this is not used in the wild
        - it should perform ok
            - client performence is importent
            - server performece should scale down and up with users
                - and federation
- what is nesseery for that
- individual components ...
## C3 I1
- is 
    - ap resilience depends on instacne relilinec
        - why?
    - instacne can do a lot to be more resilient
        - what?
    - but an instanst also must do thah
        - and it would be grade if an instacne didnot need to do all that
            - as we want smal inscances
    - but if an instacne gose down for "ever"
        - migration of an instacne in not esay as instacnes controll/own ids - new maintainer esayer
- what i want to impove
    - long therem resilinece / reducing dependencies on instacne
    - short therme -> instacnes dont need to do a lot of resilience
- what should not be impacted
    - i would like to keep generic servers - with specifc clients
      - also if this is not used in the wild
    - stay backward compatible to https or at leates make it optionals
        - is needed to be introdusable
    - client
        - performenc is important
            - get should be fast
                - ui accepteble loading times
            - send should be fast until the server
                - not an instacne message
                - a few seconds, can be async, but it should finish before use can turn of its phone
            - should feel good to use
                - every action should complete fast
                - nothing should load long
                - feel fast
                - if the newest activiy was not delivert its ok, the user dose not know it exits, but it should also not be delyed long ~5minuts
        - networking is imporatant
            - client may use bad connections
            - clietn may use metert connections
                - as littel as possible
            - clients may use nats or wired router firewalls
                - its ok to expect only ipv6 to be used / or is it?# yes
            - it should work anywhere where ap http works
                - everything without http is filter?
    - server
        - server to server can be slower
        - server to client must be fast as client requies it
        - best no impacted on performes only improvments
        - fair impcaed
            - big and smal instacne should be inpaced in a fair way
            - we want both to exists with maintaianbe resources and efford
            - should scale up and down
                - users on one instacnes
                    - small or big should work
                - number of user conections to other instances
                - federrated network site
            - repliction
                - storage should be distributed fairly
        - perfomces shoud be able to run on one vm (within reseans)
            - as a smal instacne can should not need to pay for multiple instacnes
### C3.1 ID I1
- what is part of the id portion
    - actor object and its IRI
- properties
    - read heavy
    - write once
    - should be consistend
        - at lese the things used for discovery
        - but depends on if they fail niticalbe or unnotaicave
            - e.g. old inbox might recive acitvies, but it is nolonger be queyied
            - follower collection might be updated, missing a follower in the old one
- id what if it unavaliable
    - users identitiy - be recoginsed by users or computers
    - addressing / delivery
        - direct addressing
        - indrect addressing
            - part of collections e.g. follower collections
            - part of old objects
    - discovery
        - inbox (addressing / delivery)
        - social collections, outbox
        - not as importen jet as all this is also down if the id is down
- temproraly unavaliableity
    - failed delivery
    - and posting
    - might be fixed by retansmitting
    - but this must no be the case, if it is to long
- what requirements must an id have
    - id should not change
    - actor object should be mutable
        - for features:
            - change username
            - updateing bio or summeery
            - and other preferences
                - icon - could be done another way 
        - would allow:
            - inbox, outbox and sharedinbox - IRIs to change
            - would allow social collection IRIs to change for future usage
- what requirements should an id have
    - be fast to load
        - serves do this all the time when delivering
        - also the actros client needs to rertive it fast
        - could be cached is not change that often
    - be https for backward compabiltiy
        - if http should be supported the IRI must be an https url
        - as it is delivert ot server without intacting with them
            - part of object that may be delivrety by a direct reciver to a thid party instacne
        - they would not understand other iris
        - another iri schema must be publicly dereferencable as every uri
### C3.2 Content I1
- what is part of the content portion  
    - all real content, e.g object nodes, messages
    - all pasavly used activies
    - everything whats not the inbox, outbox, id or special collection
- properties
    - write once
    - read havy
        - but embeding can make it write or more percicly create heavey
    - can by embeded
- id what if it unavaliable
    - if its not embeded in e.g. the inbox it can not be loaded
    - resulting in bad user experince as they can not view the content
    - failed deliveries:
        - ap incances should check object for validety, a unavailable object might make an actualy valid activity invalid. and there fore failing delivery of it
        - but this depends on the implementation
- temproraly unavaliableity
    - it recovers ...
    - failing delivery:
        - it also dose not recover as an invalied actvity is not retryied
        - at least not by the server, a clint might try this.
        - but this depends on the implementation, a server only implementation may catch this problem, whene it can trust its activitie, as it build them it self
- what requirements must content have
    - content must be permanent
        - real content is more important thah activies, depending on the implemention they may be uninportant
    - content ids must be permantent
        - it is used in object to rever to other object, its not feabele to change all object. especal becose the can also be under control of another inscnate, or we might even dont know them
- what requirements should content have
    - be https for backward compabiltiy
        - same as id
        - it is used in object that may reach a third party
    - its loaded by the client it should be fast.
        - it may be exaptable, that content not in the main flows is slower
            - with slow content, it clould be achived by embeding it
    - content must be mutable
        - it is only for user features
        - so we can also do immutable content
### C3.2 Social Graph Collections I1
- what is part of the content portion
    - all collecions froming part of the social grap
    - like, folow, folowing, shared ...
    - and there ids
- properties
    - read heavy
    - write once
    - write: update heavy
- id what if it unavaliable
    - used for delivery for groops
        - grops might be targeted by social graph collections. mostly as secondary audience.  if they are the primary audine, the actor is probbly also the collection owner
    - might not be able to update it.
        - this can result in a not working follow
    - social graph lost
        - the social graph is an imporatn feature
        - only a part is lost: as the follow is store in 2 collections
        - impaced:
            - some one u follow loses its social graph collection
                - you dont get activies from them any more
            - you lose ur social graph collection
                - you can not address your own follower any more
- temproraly unavaliableity
    - groube delivery
        - might be fixed by retry
    - update
        - depending on the implementation the side-effects could be retried
        - as the collections are part of the same instance
        - in most case the same server, becouse of that it did not matter
- what requirements must Social Graph Collections have
    - id must be permanent as it is used in object
    - must be mutable
        - as needed for many features as folow and co
- what requirements should Social Graph Collections have
    - id must be http compadable
    - permanent content
        - but it may be infered from in and outbox if they are persistent
        - as it is only creaed by side-effects
    - is should not be slow read
        - its used for delivery
### C3.2 IN and OUTBOX I1
- what is part of the content portion
    - IN and OUTBOX
    - and there ids
- properties
    - outbox: write once
    - inbox: write multiple
    - write heavy?
- id what if it unavaliable
    - losing recive histroy
    - losing send histroy
    - delivery dose not work
- temproraly unavaliableity
    - delivery dose not work
        - retry might help
- what requirements must IN and OUTBOX have
    - id might be mutable as it is alway looked up throue the actor object
    - content permanence
    - access controll -> acording to ap spefification
    - support a methode for non server write
- what requirements should IN and OUTBOX have
    - may suppliy https endpoint only to servers not supporting the new features, can be decided in actor object lookup
## C3 I2
- is 
Activity Pub networks are quite resilient. As any failure of a instaces, will only effect its objects and direct interactions with its objects by other instacnes.

Activity Pub dose not provide resiliens methodes for a singel instance. But instacnes could use any of the common methodes to make http apps more resilent. Like multiple servers and replicated storage. But for small instacnes this might be to much work or cost.

This might be a solution for technical failure resilient. It dose not help the instances actors if the instacne gose down intentenaly. There is now definde way to migrate an actor to another instacne. (out of band migration is possible, but can not migrate content)
- what i want to impove

In gerneral it is benifitial for an activty pub social network to be distributed among many small to medium sized instances. It dose distribute power over the network to many enteties.

Big instaces can be singel point of failure. There for lowerng network resilent.
Having big instaces also makes the network more centralised. An instace hast all the controll over its actors and there content.

The goal of this theeses is to improve activity pubs long therem resilience, against instacnce failures, by reducing the dependency of actors to there instacnes.
It also tries to make individual instacnes more resilent. So thah its esyer to operrate smal and meduim sized resilien instacne.

- what should not be impacted
The new solution must complie to the activity pub standart or extend it.

It should be compatible with activity pub https, to be easier to adopt. (why is it esier to adopt?)

    - i would like to keep generic servers - with specifc clients
      - also if this is not used in the wild

- clients
Client to server interactions should be fast enoght to not impact UI performenc.
The goals is not to become muche slower than http activtiy pub.
Therefor it must be fast to get content. As this most of the time happens on direct user action.
The inbox should also load as fast as possible. But users might be ok to wait.
It should also be resanable fast to deliver an activty. This clould be an async action.

The clients network usage should also not increase. As clients may use bad or metered connections e.g. cellular.
Clients often also have wired networks steups. They might be behind some sort of nat or rescrictive firewalls.
The new solution should work in all conditions where https activty pub would work.

- server
Servers are allowd to become slower. As long as the clients do not suffer from it.
Its more importend that the impaced is fair for big and small instacnes. As small instace should exits. But having big instacnes should also be possible.

A resonable sized server shoulbe be able to run on a singe vm. This makes operating a server easy an cheap.

A server must scale well, to be able to operate small and big instances.
The numbe of actors, would be a simple metric to scale over. It expects each actor to generate the same amount of load on average.

A bit more persice metric, is the number of connections all actors of an instace have to differten instacnes. A connections is follwoing one actor or being followed by an actor. Bothe generte a big protion of the work for an apctivity pub server. Most activies are send to followers. Most activies are resived from actors, wiche the actor follows. This still asumes that all actorse send the same amound of activies on average.

Not following readers, wiche see the contet, becouse other actores share it, are not accounted for.

Storage used for replication should also be fairly distrbuted among the instaces. Fair can be interperte in differten ways.
The simples metric would be number of actors on an instacne.
Another mectric is based on the amound of content, an instace is the origin for. This would be the faires distrubuten. But is hard to implement.
Instaces could also replicate data, there actors are intrested in. This might not distribute content evenly thouout the network. But the replication cost would be paid, by instaces benefiting form the content.

- 5 portions
The ActivtyPub api can be split in to 5 parts. These parts have different requirements for consistency, persistences and identifiers.

### C3.1 Actor I2
The Actor part constsis of the Actor Object and its ID. The Actor Object ID is also the primary methode to refer to the actor.

The Actor Object is often read by many different clients and instaces. It is rarely updated, by a singe entety. It is imported that the actor object is consistend. At least for properties linking to functional objects e.g. Inbox or Following collection. (example ????)

- what if it unavaliable
If the actor object is permanantrly unavaibe many things stop working.
Metadata e.g. perferd username can not be resolved.
Delivering activiest to the actor or its followers collections also stops working. As the actors inbox and social graph collections are discovert via the actor object. (explaint enought ????)
The actors client can not send any activies. As it discovers the outbox via the actor object.

Actors are recongnised and identified by there Actor Object ID. There for an actor looses its Identety, if the actor object is unavalible. (drive this point more in)

- temproraly unavaliableity
If the actor object is only temproraly unavaliableity some things can be fixed.
Failed delivery are retried, if the outage was short enough the activity is then delivert.
Side effects wiche faild becouse of the outgate, may get repeated. But they may also interpertert an unavalibe actro object as an invalid id and ignore it.
- what requirements must an id have
The ID of the actor object must never change. It is used to identify the user. It is embeded in many content object and collections under the authoritie of differten instacnes. Wiche makes it unpractical to update all these enties.

The actor object must be mutable. It needs to be update for some features, Like updateing the preferd username or the actors summery.
The actor object being mutable also allows to update the links to the social graph collections, in- and outbox.
- what requirements should an id have
The actor ID should be fast to load. Servers need to retrive the actor object all the time during delivery. Clients also retrive the actor object to display user metadata. (explain caching hier????)


The actor object and its id should be compatible with https activty pub servers. Therefore the actor id must be an https uri. Object contaning the actor id, may be deliverd to other instacnes withour direct interaction. Therefor it is not possible to negotiate abilies.
### C3.2 Content I2
The Content part constsis of all real content and pasavly used activies. Real content are actor produced objects, like messages or images. Thats is everything, with the exception inbox, outbox and special collections.

Content embeded into the inbox or outbox is not part of the content part. But is is also provides on its own as content. (understandable ????)

Content is written by one entity and read by many client and instacnes. Content can be updated, but this is only done as result of an deliberit actor interaction.
Content is read heavy. As any object is generaly read by more then one client.
In some implementations this might be different. Content may be deliverd, embeded in its activity. Therefore client do not need to retive the content, whene e.g reading there inbox. A social network wiche communicationg mostly small amounts of data, therefor might be writeheavy. (is this a use less fact?????)
- id what if it unavaliable
If content is unavalable, all embeded content is still accessible. Dependening on the implementaion this might be most of the content or none.
All other content from this instacne can not be retrived. In most cases this is just results in bad user experience.

Theres one scenario where temproraly unavaliableity causes a permanent failure. Activity Pub instacnes should check the validety of object, before delivering them. How to do that is not further specifided. An Instacne might check if an linked object realy exits. This fails if the object is unavaliabe and stops delivery of a genuine activtiy. 

(drving to point more in. that all data ist lost when permanantly unavaliableß????)
- what requirements must content have
Content must be permanent. Content in general should not just vanish. Some passive activites wiche are just as nodifications, like an Accept Activity for a Follow Activity, do not need to be permanent. Activities delivert to an empty audience or an no longer existing audience, might not have any value.
Content IDs must be permanent. It is embeded in many object under the authoritie of differten instacnes. Wiche makes it unfeasable to update all these objects.
- what requirements should content have
Content is loaded and displayed by the client. Therefore it must be fast to retrive. Or it could also be slower, but embedded into its activies.

Content ids must be compatible with https activity pub. Content IDs must be https url. They have the same problem with https compatably as Actor Object IDs.

Content should be mutable. Content is only update by deliberit actor interaction. If a social network dose not implement an "edit" feature, content could also be immutable.
### C3.2 Social Graph Collections I2
The Social Graph Collections include the following, followers and liked collection.

They are writen by one entetiy and read by many clients and instacnes.
The Social Graph Collections are read heavy, but they are also updated frequently.

There consistensy determens the accuracy of follower delivery. If they are not uptodate, when retrived to resolve the target audince, actvies might be delivert wrongly. Depending on the social network this may be accaptable.
- id what if it unavaliable
If the Social Graph Collections are unavaliable, delivery to followers or followes is not possible. During delivery the collection is retrived, to resolve the actrivies recipentent inboxes. Implementations may retry to resolve an unavlaible collection. But it is also accaptable to interpetert an unavlaibe collection as a invalid reccipent, if the collection is not the only recipent.

Proccessing of side effect, using the social collections, also fail, if they are unavailable. Implmentatinons do not need to retry side effect execution.

Permanantly losing Social Graph collectins is also bad. As the social graph is a quite important feature. An actor having lost there social grahpcollections, can no longer address its followers. It can still recive messages from actrors it follows, becose delivery use there following collection. The social graph collections could be inferred from the actrors complete in- and outbox, if there where lost permanatly. The in- and outbox contain all activies, wiche side effects have created the social graph collectinons state.
- what requirements must Social Graph Collections have
All social graph collections must be mutable, as they are update fequently.
Social graph collections must have permanent IDs. There ids are embeded in many object under the authoritie of differten instacnes. Wiche makes it unfeasable to update all these objects.
They are mostly used to describe the audience. Changeing the ID could couse delivery to fail, if an object refers to another object, targeting the social graph collecton by its old id, and readdreesse that objects audince. But this may be accaptable, when the referde object is old enought.
Social graph collection must be permanent. There content should not be lost. If the social graph collection fails only hard and the in- and outbox are complete and permanent, social graph collections do not need to be permanent. They can then be inferred from the in and outbox, when they fail hard.

- what requirements should Social Graph Collections have
Social graph collections should be resonable fast to read, as they are retrived during delivery.
Social graph collection its should also be compatible with https activtiy pub. Therfore they must be https url. Other IRIs would have the same problem as Content IDs and Acotr IDs have with https compatablaility.
### C3.2 IN and OUTBOX I2
The In- and Outbox part just constits of the in- and outbox.

The inbox is written to by instacnes and only read by a singel entity.

The outbox is written to by a singel entetiy and read by many clients. 

The outbox is write heavy. Activities are delivert to there recipients, sothat they do not need to querey the outbox.

- id what if it unavaliable
If the outbox is unavalible, the owner can not send activites.
Other clients can also not retrive the outbox. This is offten used by implementations to show an actors feed.

If the inbox is unavalible the owner can not retrive any activites addressed to it.
The owner also can not recive actvies, if the outbox is down. If the outbox dose not become avaliable again before the last delivery attemp, delivery of that activity fails completly. It is possible to querry the outbox of all actrors, wiche could have send an activity, to find missing activitys after an outage. But activites from an prevusly unknown actor can not be recoverd.

The in- and outbox are used as in and out feeds. If the in- or outbox is lost the feed is also lost. The content contained in the in- and outbox is store separatly and would therefor not be lost. The feeds do not have any functional value, if activity deliver is used.
- what requirements must IN and OUTBOX have
The content of the in- and outbox must be permanent. The feed should not be lost.
The in- and outbox ID may be mutable, as it is always discoverd from the actor object.
The in- and outbox must support a methode to POST objects and be able to execute side effects.
They also need to implement access controll. Only the owner must be able to read its inbox or write to its outbox.
The outbox must only provide activies the requesting actor is allowed to see. An actor is allowed to see public activies or activites, in which it is part of the audience. Dependeing on the implementation the actor musst be addresst directly or can also be targeted as part of a collection. 
- what requirements should IN and OUTBOX have
The in and outbox should be compatabile with https activtiy pub. Servers need to discover the inbox from the actor object. It would be possible to supply a backwards compatible in or outbox to https activity pub clients and instacnes.
